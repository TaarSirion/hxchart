        <p>This package allows you to create charts with Haxe.</p>
        <h1>How to install</h1>
        <p>Stable Version</p>
        <pre class="code-normal">
            <code>
                haxelib install hxchart
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Dev Version</p>
        <pre class="code-normal">
            <code>
                haxelib install hxchart https://github.com/TaarSirion/hxchart
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h1>How to create your first chart</h1>
        <p>As hxchart uses haxeui as its base, you first have to make sure to select the backend you want to work with.
            If you have never worked with haxeui see <a
                href="https://haxeui.org/api/getting-started/welcome.html">here</a> on how to use it.</p>
        <p>For convenience sake you should use html-5 as backend.</p>
        <p> Creating a chart is a straightforward process. First we
            create a trailinfo, an object containing all the information needed for the chart. Then we create the chart
            with the trailinfo. And lastly we will add the chart to the app.</p>
        <pre class="code-normal">
            <code class="language-haxe">
                var trailinfo = {
                    data: {
                        values: ["x" => [1, 2], "y" => [1, 2]]
                    },
                    type: scatter
                }
                var chart = new Chart(trailinfo);
                app.ready(function() {
                    app.addComponent(chart);
                });
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>This is the most basic you are able to create a chart. There are a lot of different options to set, see <a
                href="reference.html">reference</a> for more information</p>
        <h1>Notes on Performance</h1>
        <p>Please beware that the charts may differ in performance, depending on the chosen haxeui backend. As html-5 is
            the backend I usually test on, I make you aware that drawing scatter plots with more than 10k points will
            result in significant lag.
            That is because this library will draw the chart in svg in html, which can not be handled in large
            quantities in the browser. This means even having too many charts may result in problems, though I haven't
            tested that yet.
            There are already ways to increase performance for scatter charts, but here is also a small tip: <br>
            Always think about the necessity of drawing so many points.
            Usually it is not helpful from an analysis perspective, to have a cluster of 10k points sitting all on top
            of each other.</p>
